C.GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DOMAIN
This system will perform many functions such as: Tracking inventory, sales,
handling payments, managing users, calculating pricing, give receipts, returns,
and scanning item barcodes.

This machine will primarily be used for a small store, with no franchises, and
sells non-electronic games and cards. The machine will be equipped with a cash
drawer, and a credit card reader.

D. CUSTOMERS AND USERS

CUSTOMERS
Customers of the game store include adults and adolescents, both groups can be expected to represent a repeat customer base. The
demographics of the customer base will be based upon the physical location of the store, variety of merchandise sold, volume of
inventory, and the pricing of the merchandise. Due to the single location of the store and non-electronic nature of the stock,
face-to-face and online commerce can be expected to be the two ways in which the system is used to sell merchandise.

USERS
Sales associates include the floor staff who are in charge of stocking goods and maintaining the appearance of the store. Additional
sale associates include salespersons and cashiers who assist customers and encourage purchases on the sales floor, they interact
directly with other employees in the workplace and incoming customers. The sales associates will need to have sufficient knowledge of
how to operate the software in order to create and complete transactions. In the event of a conflict during a transaction, it is
expected that a manager or supervisor will be called to give access to functions other than basic transactions.

Managers and shift supervisors are employees who are in control of delegating tasks and ensuring proper optimization of store
functions; they have special access to the software that associates do not have. Each supervisor is given a code that can be entered
into the system in order to complete returns, enter a “No Sale,” and resolve conflicts that may arise during a transaction. As such,
managerial staff will require a higher level of training in regards to the software.

Outlier users of the system consist of suppliers of merchandise and shipping companies that deliver stock to the store and to online
customers. Banking and credit card companies represent users of the system based on their monetary communication with the system. If
the store has a lease or a mortgage then either a bank or a landlord will have an indirect role within the system. These users will
have little to no direct access to the software, but they will receive communication from it.

E. THE ENVIRONMENT
A Java program running a operating system of Windows 7 or higher, Mac OS X, or
Linux. The operating system in question also needs to be able to run a MySQL
database.

The program should allow for a receipt printer, a bar code scanner, and a credit
card reader over usb 1.0.

The main input method should be over keyboard and mouse using usb 1.0.

F. TAKES AND PROCEDURES CURRENTLY PERFORMED
Point of Sale: Display time on POS and record on transactions. Allow users to
add and remove items to current transaction.

Payment: Allow customers to pay in cash or credit. For cash, cashier will enter
amount and POS will calculate and display change. For credit the POS will read
the card, then verify and bill through an API (notify of success or failure).

Print Receipt: The POS will print a receipt when the transaction completes. It
will include the Store name, store phone number, Time, items and prices on
transaction, subtotal, tax, total, payment method (and change) as well as
receipt message.

Returns: Load the transaction from receipt number. Check that returned item is
on transaction. Record the reason for the return. Calculate and display the
refund amount. Allow for refund to credited to original credit card. Update
the current inventory with returned item if item is resellable (if return
reason allows).

Pricing: This will be handled by the database. All of the info about the
pricing, including time at point of sale and profit made, will be stored in a
database and called on when needed.

Inventory: This data will also be stored on a database. When a query is made as
to whether or not we have an item in stock, it will return true if the item
quantity on hand is above zero, and false if otherwise. Also once items are
sold, it will subtract the corresponding quantity from the database.

I/O: All of these items, barcode scanner, receipt printer, and cash drawer, will
work off the serial ports on the computer, and by implementing a script in C,
so that we can interact with these things in our Java source code.

Admin settings: Admin settings will also be stored on the database. Whenever a
user is created, they will be given a ranking, which corresponds to a heirarchy
table in the database, stating which actions they can and cannot perform. So all
that will be required of the local system is a simple check of the user’s
permissions before performing an operation that would require management
approval, and if the user currently logged in is not approved for those
functions, an override prompt will appear. Special receipt messages can be
stored locally and referenced at time of receipt printing.

Users: Login will mostly be handled by the database; when a user attempts to
log in the database will validate their uName and pWord, and the code will
handle locking/unlocking based on the signal from the database. Managing
accounts (CRUD) will all be handled by the database; all CRUD functions will be
located there, and can be used after user validation (see Security Settings).
Overrides will perform CRUD operations on any database values, after user
validation (see Security Settings).

Security Settings: A user database will be maintained, with username, password,
and privileges. In order to validate privilege, a database call will be made to
ensure that the user has appropriate authority to perform whatever actions they
are attempting to perform.

Tax: Every inventory item will be given an enumeration that corresponds to a
value in a separate tax database. The local machine will gather the appropriate
information and calculate tax.

H. SIMILARITIES ACROSS DOMAINS
The similarities with our POS system and others in the domain is
the ability to handle simple transactions, track inventory, and handle multiple
users with different levels of security. Our system does not handle trade-in
calculations or track used products. It is assumed that the products are sold as
new.
